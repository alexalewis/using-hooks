# Using Hooks

Represent the three values, hue, saturation, and lightness with hooks.
Add three sliders that update their respective values (hue, saturation, and lightness).
Display the color on the screen, in both text (i.e. hsl(50, 8%, 20%)) and the actual color as a background color on an element.
Initialize the hooks to a random color when the page is loaded.
Add a button that picks a new random color.
